Working Loads:  No blanket safe working load (SWL) recommendations can be made for any  line because SWL's must be calculated based on application, conditions  of use, and potential danger to personnel among other considerations. It  is recommended that the end user establish working loads and safety  factors based on best practices established by the end user's industry;  by professional judgment and personal experience; and after thorough  assessment of all risks. The SWL is a guideline for the use of a rope in  good condition for non-critical applications and should be reduced  where life, limb, or valuable property is involved, or in cases of  exceptional service such as shock loading, sustained loading, severe  vibration, etc. The Cordage Institute specifies that the SWL of a rope  shall be determined by dividing the Minimum Tensile Strength of the rope  by a safety factor. The safety factor ranges from 5 to 12 for  non-critical uses and is typically set at 15 for life lines.",0,Layline,0,J80 Club Spinnaker Halyard,J80 Club Spinnaker Halyard-VPC Solid Blue,70.44,1000,J80CSHVPCB,0

Dielectrics:  Good resistance to the passage of electrical current. However, dirt, surface contaminants, water entrapment, and the like can significantly affect dielectric properties. Extreme caution should be exercised any time a rope is in the proximity of live circuits.     Sheaves:  Recommended sheave diameter to rope diameter is 8:1.     Working Loads:  No blanket safe working load (SWL) recommendations can be made for any line because SWL's must be calculated based on application, conditions of use, and potential danger to personnel among other considerations. It is recommended that the end user establish working loads and safety factors based on best practices established by the end user's industry; by professional judgment and personal experience; and after thorough assessment of all risks. The SWL is a guideline for the use of a rope in good condition for non-critical applications and should be reduced where life, limb, or valuable property is involved, or in cases of exceptional service such as shock loading, sustained loading, severe vibration, etc. The Cordage Institute specifies that the SWL of a rope shall be determined by dividing the Minimum Tensile Strength of the rope by a safety factor. The safety factor ranges from 5 to 12 for non-critical uses and is typically set at 15 for life lines.",http://www.layline.com/media/catalog/product/M/A/MARINE_VPC_1_16.gif,0,0,0,VPC Hybrid Performance Braid,1.44,960,NER2832.08,0

Through the use of advanced composites, these cleats achieve superior performance while overcoming the limitations of metal alloys. Ronstan cam cleats are strong, light and corrosion free. The unique tooth profile and cam geometry are designed to grip without damaging the rope. A multi-coil spring recessed in the upper part of the cam generates near constant torque. This constant torque ensures secure cleating of even the smallest lines with minimal abrasion or rope wear and low line entry and exit efforts.

"&nbsp;      	Product Information      	For small keel boats and sportsboats T-track jib leads are a great blend of performance and functionality in a simple, efficient package. Composite slide bodies with plunger stops run on anodised aluminium track, and allow quick and easy manual adjustment.&nbsp;      	   	Lightweight      	Composite jib lead cars continue the design philosophy of the award winning Ronstan BB and RT Orbit Blocks&trade;, with virtually all metal components now replaced with high-tech polymers and fibre equivalents. The car design has been modelled and optimised using finite element analysis and rapid prototyping techniques to achieve maximum strength-to-weight characteristics. Orbit Block&trade; models use a Dyneema&reg;&nbsp;Link which is 10 times stronger and lighter than steel, to provide the articulated connection between block and car.      	   	Integrated Functionality      	The clever 2-piece car body is moulded from a composite material that delivers low friction on the alloy track without the need for separate inserts. It also provides the required mechanical strength without the weight and corrosion drawbacks of metal parts. An integrated becket at the forward end of the car suits 2:1 sheet systems and the removable threaded pin allows easy fitting of alternate blocks and accessories.      	   	Low Profile and Compact      	Sleek styling and the positioning of the attachment pin provide a low lead aft for the lead block. The Dyneema&reg;&nbsp;Link allows full articulation. The plunger stop button has a flush finish and the contoured form of the car eliminates the chance of lines and sails becoming snagged.      	   	Precise Adjustment      	The ergonomic plunger stop toggle combined with low friction of the car body allows for easy one-handed adjustment. The toggle is located at the rear of the car for easy access from the cockpit on sports boats and small keel boats. An arrow is located on the side to indicate the position of the stop for repeatable settings.
